This folder contains all three c programming files for 3 tasks and one excel sheet for graph. And this readme file

osproj2a.c - this file is to calculate pi value using random points which fall inside the square or circle method, using threads
osproj2b.c - this program is to calculate fibonacci series using threads. Each thread calls another thread to continue the calculation and waits for it.
osproj2c.c - this program is to seperate words which start with vowels and consonents. Two different threads search for them and they yield to one another if they cannot find what they are meant to search for.

osproj2a_graph.xlsx consists of all 21 sample points with the threads and time taken in milliseconds and also the approximate value obtained.
